#roitools

Tools and helpers for planning and analyzing regions of interest (ROIs) in video files.

This software consists of three main parts:

- an easy to use facade for the `cv2.VideoCapture` class called `PyCap` (`vidtools.py`)
- an observable subclass `RoiCap` to which regions of interest can be added as observers (`roitools.py`)
- a graphical user interface for planning ROIs (`roi_planner_gui.py`).
